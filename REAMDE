============================== SuDoku ==============================

A ( for now ) simple SuDoku solver that uses human logics instead of brue force.
It will only be able to solve SuDoku boards that have only one solution. 
The current version is able to solve most SuDokus withinn 1 ms  if running with optimization.

Solving SuDokus


Compilation:
I personally use g++ with the following flags
-Werror
-Wall
-Weffc
-Wextra
-pedantic
	This flags all adds warnings ( -Werror turns warnings into errors. ) 
	This helps detecting logical errors and it tells you about unused/uninitialized variables.
	The Werror flag "forces" you to fix any warnings
-lrt
-std=c++0x
	Needed for some features

Full compiler string
	g++ main.cpp Board.cpp -Wall -Werror -Wextra -Weffc++ -pedantic -lrt -o SuDoku -std=c++0x
